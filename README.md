## Summary

Spotifight is a guessing game about your Spotify liked songs folder. Do you know them like the back of your hand?

## How to play the game

First, you will be asked to log in to your Spotify account. Once that's done, you will have access to four games based on your favorite songs. If you don't have favorite songs, you are invited to add some to have fun on Spotifight!
- Which song for these lyrics: You will have some lyrics and need to discover which song they belong to. You will have four attempts. At each attempt, the following sentence of the lyrics will help you guess.
- Album cover guessing: You will see a blurred album cover and need to discover its title. You will have four attempts, and at each one, the blur will decrease to help you guess.
- Sample hearing: You will hear an extract from a song and need to discover its title. You will have four attempts.
- Find the artist: You will have four hints about a specific artist, appearing each time you lose an attempt: the number of monthly listeners, his oldest album cover, his most popular song, and finally, his icon image.
